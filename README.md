# GB Cardputer
Run GameBoy games on your M5Stack Cardputer!*

Uses [Peanut-GB](https://github.com/deltabeard/Peanut-GB), a super cool project that's basically an entire GameBoy emulator in a single C header!

# Warning
This "port" is not polished at all, the code needs major commenting, refactoring and other general cleanup.

Audio also doesn't work, since I just didn't feel like making it work for now lol, though I might addreess that later on

I just cobbled this together between yesterday (17/1/2024) and today just to mess around with the Cardputer a bit.
